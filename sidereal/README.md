This is a piece I originally did inspired by a Disquiet Junto task explained here: https://disquiet.com/2020/01/16/disquiet-junto-project-0420-luna-tick/

I was only able to upload the orchestra file, but the uploaded concept test is a taste of what the whole piece was like.
The basic idea behind it is that it is meant to start on the full moon and it lasts for a sidereal month and has changes 
that are calculated to occur with the changing of the phases of the moon.
